# ir-devices
Contains JSON files which works with the ircontroller and multiremote project.

## displays
Holds any kind of display, lcd, plasma, projectors, etc.

## players
Any kind of media player, including HTPCs and DVDs

## consoles
Gaming consoles

## accessories
Items which don't fit the other categories, such as projector screens, hdmi splitter/switches, etc.

# Format
All files are in json format, if the device has discreet on/off codes, they should be labeled as such.
If they only have the regular toggle code, name it toggle (easy, huh?)

Filename convention is equally easy, once placed in the correct folder, they should be named
manufactor-model.json, so a Sony PS3 becomes: sony-playstation3.json

Easy peasy
